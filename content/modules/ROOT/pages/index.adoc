= Defense in Depth: Advanced Security for Container Workloads on ROSA

Welcome to the *Defense in Depth: Advanced Security for Container Workloads on ROSA* workshop!

In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to implement enterprise-grade security for containerized workloads running on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). You'll gain practical experience with critical security capabilities that address the most common Kubernetes security challenges.

== Why this workshop matters

In today's cloud-native landscape, security is paramount. Organizations face increasing pressure to:

* Deploy applications faster while maintaining enterprise-grade security
* Eliminate security vulnerabilities from static credentials and exposed secrets
* Achieve compliance with industry regulations (PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, FedRAMP)
* Reduce operational overhead of managing container platforms
* Integrate seamlessly with existing AWS services and security tooling

This workshop demonstrates how ROSA addresses these challenges through a defense-in-depth security strategy that combines OpenShift's enterprise Kubernetes capabilities with native AWS security services.

== What you'll accomplish

By the end of this workshop, you'll have built a fully operational ROSA cluster integrated with AWS security services, including:

* Centralized logging with Amazon CloudWatch
* A cloud-native Java application deployed with secure AWS integration using IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)
* External secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
* Production-ready security patterns you can apply in your own environments
