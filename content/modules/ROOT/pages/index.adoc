= Defense in Depth: Advanced Security for Container Workloads on ROSA

Welcome to the *Defense in Depth: Advanced Security for Container Workloads on ROSA* workshop!

In this hands-on workshop, you'll implement enterprise-grade security for containerized workloads on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), gaining practical experience with critical Kubernetes security capabilities.

== Why this workshop matters

In today's cloud-native landscape, security is paramount. Organizations face increasing pressure to:

* Deploy applications faster while maintaining enterprise-grade security
* Eliminate security vulnerabilities from static credentials and exposed secrets
* Achieve compliance with industry regulations (PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, FedRAMP)
* Reduce operational overhead of managing container platforms
* Integrate seamlessly with existing AWS services and security tooling

This workshop demonstrates how ROSA addresses these challenges through a defense-in-depth security strategy that combines OpenShift's enterprise Kubernetes capabilities with native AWS security services.
