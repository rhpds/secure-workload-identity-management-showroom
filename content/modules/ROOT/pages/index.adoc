== Introduction and Lab Overview

Welcome to the *Defense in Depth: Advanced Security for Container Workloads on ROSA* Lab.

This lab is designed to show you how to enable organizations to build a highly secure, auditable, and operationally efficient application platform on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

=== Who This Workshop Is For

This workshop is aimed at Platform Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Cloud Operations, Architects, and Developers that want to learn about secure application delivery using ROSA.

=== What to Expect

During the workshop, we will take you through a series of hands-on exercises to help you understand some of the core security concepts of modern cloud application platform.

// --- Learning Objectives ---

== Learning Objectives

Attendees will gain practical knowledge and skills in the following key areas:

* ROSA architecture and its differentiation from self-managed OpenShift.
* Integration of ROSA telemetry with Amazon CloudWatch for centralized logging and auditing.
* Deployment of an application that uses *AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts* and *AWS STS* to connect to an Amazon DynamoDB table, eliminating static credentials.
* Usage of *AWS Secrets Manager* with ROSA for externalized configuration and secrets management.
* Provisioning of AWS resources using *AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)* directly from ROSA.
* Application of advanced networking constructs, specifically OpenShift **Network Policies**, for workload microsegmentation.
* Operationalizing cluster visibility and workload governance using *Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS)*.
* Integration of ROSA with *Amazon Cognito* for federated authentication and user access control.
