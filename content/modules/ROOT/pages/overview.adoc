= Workshop overview

== What you will learn

This hands-on workshop teaches you how to implement defense-in-depth security for containerized workloads on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). You will gain practical experience with critical security capabilities that address the most common Kubernetes security challenges.

== Learning objectives

By completing this workshop, you will be able to:

* *Validate ROSA environment readiness* by verifying CLI tools, AWS quotas, and cluster prerequisites for production deployment
* *Configure secure cluster access* using local admin authentication and OpenShift web console navigation
* *Implement centralized logging* by integrating ROSA with Amazon CloudWatch using OpenShift Logging 6.x and Loki stack
* *Eliminate static credentials* by deploying applications with IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for AWS service integration
* *Manage external secrets securely* using AWS Secrets Manager CSI driver to separate sensitive data from application code
* *Apply defense-in-depth principles* by combining multiple security layers for comprehensive workload protection

== Skills you will develop

*Technical skills:*

* ROSA cluster architecture and AWS service integration
* OpenShift Logging 6.x configuration with Loki and CloudWatch
* AWS IAM trust policies and STS credential management
* Kubernetes service account configuration for cloud provider integration
* Secrets management using CSI drivers and external secret stores
* Cloud-native application deployment with security best practices

*Security skills:*

* Implementing least-privilege access controls
* Configuring audit logging and centralized monitoring
* Eliminating credential exposure risks
* Applying compliance controls for regulated workloads

* Centralized logging pipeline forwarding to Amazon CloudWatch
* A Java application (Microsweeper game) deployed using:
** Source-to-Image (S2I) build process
** IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for DynamoDB access
** AWS Secrets Manager for configuration management
* Production-ready security patterns for cloud-native applications

== Business value proposition

Organizations implementing Red Hat OpenShift cloud services achieve significant measurable business value:

* *468% ROI over 3 years* with $4.08M net present value for composite organizations^1^
* *70% shorter application development cycle* through managed OpenShift platform^1^
* *20% of developer time recaptured* due to reduced infrastructure maintenance requirements^1^
* *90% of organizations experienced Kubernetes security incidents* in the past year, highlighting the critical need for defense-in-depth security^2^
* *67% delayed application deployment* due to security concerns, emphasizing the importance of integrated security^2^

== Real-world impact

Organizations across industries report significant business outcomes from implementing comprehensive Kubernetes security:

* *Security incident prevention*: Eliminating static credentials through IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) reduces credential-related security risks
* *Compliance acceleration*: Integrated audit logging with AWS CloudWatch streamlines SOC 2, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance processes
* *Operational efficiency*: Managed OpenShift control plane reduces infrastructure management overhead and improves reliability
* *Financial impact*: 46% of organizations experienced revenue or customer loss due to security incidents^1^, making proactive security essential
