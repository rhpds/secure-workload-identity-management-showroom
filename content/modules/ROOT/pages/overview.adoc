= Workshop overview

== Learning objectives

This hands-on workshop teaches you to implement defense-in-depth security for containerized workloads on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). By completing this workshop, you will be able to:

* *Validate ROSA environment readiness* by verifying CLI tools, AWS quotas, and cluster prerequisites for production deployment
* *Configure secure cluster access* using local admin authentication and OpenShift web console navigation
* *Implement centralized logging* by integrating ROSA with Amazon CloudWatch using OpenShift Logging 6.x and Loki stack
* *Eliminate static credentials* by deploying applications with IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for AWS service integration
* *Manage external secrets securely* using AWS Secrets Manager CSI driver to separate sensitive data from application code
* *Apply defense-in-depth principles* by combining multiple security layers for comprehensive workload protection

== Skills you will develop

* ROSA cluster architecture and AWS service integration
* OpenShift Logging 6.x with Loki and CloudWatch
* AWS IAM trust policies, STS credential management, and IRSA
* Secrets management using CSI drivers and AWS Secrets Manager
* Least-privilege access controls and compliance for regulated workloads
* Cloud-native application deployment with security best practices

* A fully operational ROSA cluster integrated with AWS security services
* Centralized logging pipeline forwarding to Amazon CloudWatch
* A Java application (Microsweeper game) deployed using:
** Source-to-Image (S2I) build process
** IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for DynamoDB access
** AWS Secrets Manager for configuration management
* AWS infrastructure (S3 buckets) provisioned via AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)
* Network Policies implementing zero-trust networking patterns
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) for vulnerability detection and policy enforcement
* Amazon Cognito integration for enterprise SSO authentication
* Production-ready security patterns for cloud-native applications

== Business value

Organizations implementing Red Hat OpenShift cloud services achieve measurable business outcomes:

*Financial impact:*

* *468% ROI over 3 years* with $4.08M net present value^1^
* *70% shorter application development cycle* through managed OpenShift^1^
* *20% of developer time recaptured* from reduced infrastructure maintenance^1^

*Security impact:*

* *90% of organizations experienced Kubernetes security incidents* in the past year^2^
* *67% delayed application deployment* due to security concerns^2^
* *46% experienced revenue or customer loss* from security incidents^2^

*What this workshop delivers:*

* Eliminate static credentials through IRSA to reduce credential-related risks
* Streamline SOC 2, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compliance with centralized CloudWatch logging
* Reduce infrastructure overhead with managed OpenShift control plane
