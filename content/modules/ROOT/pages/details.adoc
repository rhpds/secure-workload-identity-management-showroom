== Environment information

=== Provided resources

Your workshop environment includes:

* *Pre-deployed ROSA cluster* - A fully managed Red Hat OpenShift cluster running on AWS
* *AWS account access* - Credentials and access to required AWS services
* *Bastion host* - Terminal access for running commands
* *Pre-installed tools*:
** ROSA CLI (`rosa`)
** OpenShift CLI (`oc`)
** AWS CLI (`aws`)
** Git, Helm, and other development tools

=== Required variables

Throughout the workshop, you will use several environment variables. These are pre-configured in your workshop environment and displayed on your workshop landing page.

**OpenShift cluster access:**

* `{rosa_openshift_console_url}` - OpenShift web console URL (used throughout all labs)
* `{rosa_openshift_admin_user}` - Pre-created admin username (used in all labs if pre-provisioned)
* `{rosa_openshift_admin_password}` - Pre-created admin password (used in all labs if pre-provisioned)
* `{rosa_openshift_api_url}` - OpenShift API URL for CLI login (used in all labs if pre-provisioned)

**Bastion host SSH access:**

* `{ssh_command}` - Full SSH command to connect to bastion (e.g., `ssh rosa@bastion.tw27g.sandbox3402.opentlc.com`)
* `{ssh_username}` (or `{bastion_ssh_user_name}`) - SSH username (typically `rosa`)
* `{ssh_password}` (or `{bastion_ssh_password}`) - SSH password for bastion access
* `{targethost}` (or `{bastion_public_hostname}`) - Bastion hostname

**AWS Console access:**

* `{aws_web_console_url}` - AWS web console login URL (used in Lab 3 for CloudWatch verification)
* `{aws_web_console_user_name}` - AWS console username
* `{aws_web_console_password}` - AWS console password

**AWS CLI credentials (pre-configured):**

* `{aws_access_key_id}` - AWS access key ID (pre-configured in environment)
* `{aws_secret_access_key}` - AWS secret access key (pre-configured in environment)
* `{aws_default_region}` (or `{aws_sandbox_account_id}`) - AWS region (typically us-east-2)

**Workshop identifier:**

* `{guid}` - Your unique workshop identifier (used in Labs 2, 4 for resource naming)

**Dynamically derived variables (set automatically during labs):**

The following variables are automatically retrieved from your cluster during the labs - you do NOT need to set these manually:

* `REGION` - Retrieved from cluster configuration in Lab 3
* `OIDC_ENDPOINT` - Retrieved from cluster authentication in Lab 3
* `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` - Retrieved using `aws sts get-caller-identity` in Lab 3
* `CLUSTER_NAME` - Derived from cluster API server URL in Lab 3
* `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Created when you run `rosa create admin` in Lab 2 (if not pre-provisioned)

**Example commands from Lab 3:**

[source,bash]
----
export REGION=$(oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath="{.status.platformStatus.aws.region}")
export OIDC_ENDPOINT=$(oc get authentication.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.serviceAccountIssuer}' | sed 's|^https://||')
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
export CLUSTER_NAME=$(oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath="{.status.apiServerURL}" | awk -F '.' '{print $2}')
----

**Where to find these variables:**

All pre-configured variables are displayed on your workshop landing page. You can reference them anytime during the workshop.

**When you'll need these variables:**

* **Lab 1**: ROSA CLI authentication (uses pre-configured token)
* **Lab 2**: OpenShift cluster login (CLI and web console)
* **Lab 3**: CloudWatch verification in AWS console, OpenShift console for viewing logs
* **Lab 4**: OpenShift console for viewing builds, deployments, and routes
* **Lab 5**: Optional OpenShift console access for verification
* **All labs**: Bastion host SSH access for running commands

=== AWS services used

This workshop integrates with the following AWS services:

* *Amazon CloudWatch* - Centralized logging and monitoring
* *AWS IAM* - Identity and access management
* *AWS STS* - Security Token Service for temporary credentials
* *Amazon S3* - Object storage for Loki log storage
* *Amazon DynamoDB* - NoSQL database for application data
* *AWS Secrets Manager* - External secrets management

=== OpenShift components used

You will work with these OpenShift operators and components:

* *OpenShift Logging 6.x* - Log collection and forwarding
* *Loki Operator* - Efficient log storage backend
* *Cluster Observability Operator* - Logging UI integration
* *Secrets Store CSI Driver* - External secrets mounting
* *Source-to-Image (S2I)* - Container image building

== What to expect

=== Hands-on learning approach

* *Execute real commands* - You'll run actual commands against a live ROSA cluster
* *See immediate results* - Each step produces visible outcomes
* *Build progressively* - Each lab builds on previous labs
* *Enterprise patterns* - Learn production-ready security practices

=== Workshop flow

1. *Environment validation* - Verify all tools and access are ready
2. *Cluster access* - Authenticate and explore your ROSA cluster
3. *Logging setup* - Configure enterprise observability
4. *Application deployment* - Deploy a cloud-native app with secure AWS integration
5. *Secrets management* - Implement external secret store integration

=== Support and troubleshooting

* *Self-paced* - Work at your own speed
* *Verification commands* - Each lab includes commands to verify success
* *Expected outputs* - Sample outputs help you confirm correct execution
* *Troubleshooting tips* - Common issues and solutions provided
* *Lab instructors* - Available to assist if you encounter issues

== Technical requirements

=== Network access

* *Internet connectivity* required for AWS and Red Hat services
* *OpenShift console access* via HTTPS
* *Terminal/SSH access* to bastion host

=== Browser compatibility

* Modern web browser for OpenShift web console
* Recommended: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (latest versions)

=== Skills assessment

*Beginner level:*
