= Lab 1: Explore your ROSA environment

== Learning objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Verify ROSA CLI installation and version compatibility for production deployment
* Validate AWS CLI configuration and authentication for ROSA operations
* Confirm AWS quota availability for ROSA cluster requirements
* Understand ROSA login and authentication flow using Red Hat Cloud Console
* Validate OpenShift client tools for cluster management

== Value proposition

*For field teams*: This lab demonstrates ROSA's enterprise readiness by showing how easily customers can validate their AWS environment before deployment. Use this to address common objections about AWS readiness and deployment complexity.

*Customer proof points*:

* *Reduced deployment risk*: Environment validation catches issues before deployment, preventing common misconfigurations that account for 53% of Kubernetes security incidents^1^
* *Faster time-to-production*: Pre-flight checks eliminate troubleshooting delays in AWS environment preparation
* *AWS integration confidence*: ROSA's native AWS integration provides production-ready managed OpenShift on AWS infrastructure

== The workshop environment you are using

Your environment has already been set up with the tools you need to work with ROSA and AWS.

Your workshop environment consists of several components which have been pre-configured and are ready to use.
This includes an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, and many other supporting resources.

ROSA is enabled on the AWS account used for this lab - and the ROSA CLI as well as AWS CLI tools are installed and configured on your bastion VM.

[NOTE]
====
All commands in this workshop can be run using the integrated web terminal in the Showroom interface (visible on the right side of your browser), or by connecting via SSH to the bastion host using the credentials below.
====

**Bastion Host SSH Access (Optional):**

=== Validate installed tools

You will be using the `rosa`, `aws` and `oc` command line tools throughout this lab.

. Verify that the `rosa` command line tool is installed (note that your version may be a more recent version than the output shown below):
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa version
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
1.2.37
Your ROSA CLI is up to date.
----

. Verify that the `aws` command line tool is installed:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
aws --version
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
aws-cli/2.15.39 Python/3.11.8 Linux/5.14.0-362.18.1.el9_3.x86_64 exe/x86_64.rhel.9 prompt/off
----

. Verify that the `aws` command line tool is configured correctly:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
aws sts get-caller-identity
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
{
    "UserId": "AIDA52VPS74UJLY4GUW7L",
    "Account": "950629760808",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::950629760808:user/wkulhane@redhat.com-nhnv4"
}
----

. Verify that the `oc` CLI is installed correctly
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa verify openshift-client
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
I: Verifying whether OpenShift command-line tool is available...
I: Current OpenShift Client Version: 4.15.9
----

. Rosa login
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa login
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
I: Logged in as 'rhpds-cloud' on 'https://api.openshift.com'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Normally you would need to get a *token* from the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa[Red Hat Console] and log into ROSA using that token.

In this environment your token has been preconfigured for you.
====

. Run rosa whoami to verify your credentials:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa whoami
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----

=== Review quota

. You must ensure your AWS account has enough resources available to run ROSA. Use the following command to review available AWS quota:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa verify quota
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
I: Validating AWS quota...
I: AWS quota ok. If cluster installation fails, validate actual AWS resource usage against https://docs.openshift.com/
rosa/rosa_getting_started/rosa-required-aws-service-quotas.html
----
+
See link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas.html[the documentation^] for more details regarding quotas.

== Summary

Congratulations! You have now successfully validated your ROSA environment.

=== What you accomplished

In this lab, you:

* ✅ Verified ROSA CLI installation and version (demonstrating ROSA's mature tooling ecosystem)
* ✅ Validated AWS CLI configuration with proper authentication (showing native AWS integration)
* ✅ Confirmed OpenShift client tools are properly installed (highlighting familiar Kubernetes tooling)
* ✅ Authenticated to Red Hat Cloud Console via ROSA CLI (demonstrating Red Hat's unified management)
* ✅ Verified AWS quota availability for ROSA deployment (proving production readiness)

=== Key takeaways for customer conversations

* *Enterprise tooling*: ROSA provides production-grade CLI tools that integrate seamlessly with existing DevOps workflows
* *AWS-native integration*: ROSA authentication uses standard AWS IAM, reducing security complexity and leveraging existing AWS investments
* *Pre-deployment validation*: Built-in verification commands reduce deployment risk and accelerate time-to-production
* *Unified management*: Single Red Hat Cloud Console for managing ROSA across multiple AWS regions and accounts

=== Next steps

You are now ready to access your ROSA cluster and begin configuring secure workload deployments.

In the next lab, you will create cluster admin access and log in to the OpenShift web console.
